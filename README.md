##Overview

StatVizPro is a comprehensive statistical analysis and visualization toolkit designed for data scientists and researchers. This package provides an extensive suite of functions to simplify complex data analysis, statistical modeling, and visualization tasks. With a focus on usability and flexibility, StatVizPro is the perfect tool for handling large datasets, generating automated reports, and creating high-quality visualizations.

###Features
- Automated report generation
- Customizable charting options
- Advanced statistical tests and modeling
- Support for large datasets

##Installation

To install the development version of StatVizPro from GitHub, use the following commands:

```R
# Install devtools if you haven't already
install.packages("devtools")

# Install StatVizPro from GitHub
devtools::install_github("yourusername/StatVizPro")
```

##Dependencies

StatVizPro depends on the following R packages:
- `ggplot2`
- `dplyr`
- `tidyr`
- `stats`

Ensure these packages are installed and up-to-date.

##Main Functions

Here are the key functions included in the package:

###`analyze_data(data)`
Performs comprehensive statistical analysis on a given dataset. Includes summary statistics, hypothesis testing, and more.
```R
result <- analyze_data(iris)
print(result)
```

###`visualize_data(data, type, options = list())`
Generates customizable visualizations like scatter plots, histograms, and boxplots. 
- `type`: Type of visualization (e.g., "scatter", "boxplot").
- `options`: A list of customization parameters.
```R
visualize_data(iris, type = "scatter", options = list(color = "Species"))
```

###`generate_report(data, output_file)`
Creates an automated report summarizing analysis and visualizations. Supports PDF and HTML outputs.
```R
generate_report(iris, output_file = "report.html")
```

###`model_data(data, formula, model_type)`
Fits statistical models (e.g., linear regression, logistic regression) to the data.
- `formula`: Model formula.
- `model_type`: Type of model (e.g., "lm", "glm").
```R
model <- model_data(iris, formula = Sepal.Length ~ Sepal.Width, model_type = "lm")
summary(model)
```

###`handle_large_data(data, chunk_size)`
Optimized functions for working with large datasets, enabling chunked operations and efficient summaries.
```R
summary <- handle_large_data(large_dataset, chunk_size = 1000)
print(summary)
```

# Getting Started

Here is a quick example of how to use StatVizPro:

```R
# Load the package
library(StatVizPro)

# Example usage: Perform a basic statistical analysis and visualization
data <- iris
result <- analyze_data(data)
visualize_data(data, type = "scatter")
```

##Future Work

The package is currently in its early stages (version 0.0.0.9000). Future updates will include:
- Enhanced visualization themes
- Additional statistical tests and modeling functions
- Improved support for interactive visualizations
